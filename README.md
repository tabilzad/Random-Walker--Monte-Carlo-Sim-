# Random Walker Monte Carlo Simulation


The random walk of a single diffusing reactant (particle) toward a centrosymmetric stationary reaction center (trap) on a periodic square lattice. This Monte Carlo method was used to support analytic arguments of the expected walk length <n> for random walks on d-dimentional lattices with traps. Alternative simulations have also been performed on a variety of different fractal lattices like Menger Sponge and Sierpinski structures.
